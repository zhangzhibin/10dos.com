## Why only 10 tasks?

Limiting the list forces you to choose what really matters. Instead of an endless backlog, you keep only the 10 things you care about right now. When you finish one, you decide what deserves the free slot. It helps you prioritize and let go of the rest.

## Is my data stored or sent anywhere?

No. Your tasks are stored only in your browser’s local storage on your device. Nothing is uploaded to our servers or any third party. There is no account and no sync.

## Does it work offline?

Yes. Once the extension is installed, your todo list works offline. All data stays on your device.

## Which browsers are supported?

10dos is available as a Chrome extension (Chrome Web Store). Support for other browsers may be added later.

## Can I have more than 10 tasks?

The design is intentionally limited to 10 slots. The idea is to keep a small, focused list and complete it, then refresh. If you need more items, you can replace completed tasks with new ones.
