One list. Ten slots. No account. Your tasks stay in your browser.

A lightweight todo that lives in your browser. No sign-up, no sync—just **10 slots**. You choose the 10 things that matter most right now and leave the rest behind.

By limiting the list, you learn to **prioritize** and **let go**. Finish what's on the list, then decide what deserves a slot next.

Unlike endless todo apps, 10dos forces you to choose—so you actually finish.

## How it works

1. **Install** the extension and pin it to your toolbar.
2. **Pick 10** — only the tasks that matter most right now.
3. **Complete & replace** — finish one, free a slot, choose what goes in next.

## Why 10?

- Runs in the browser — no account, no install beyond the extension
- Exactly 10 tasks — forces you to pick what really matters
- Drop what doesn't fit — practice saying no to the rest
- Do less, finish more — focus on a small set and complete it
