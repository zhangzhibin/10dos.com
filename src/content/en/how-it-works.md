## How 10dos works

1. **Install** the extension from the Chrome Web Store and pin it to your toolbar if you like.
2. **Pick 10 tasks** — only the ones that matter most right now. Everything else stays off the list.
3. **Complete** tasks one by one. When you finish one, you get a free slot.
4. **Choose again** — put the next most important task in the empty slot, or leave it open until something deserves it.

By keeping the list short, you focus on doing instead of collecting. You learn to say no to the rest and finish what’s on the list.

No account, no sync, no clutter. Just 10 slots in your browser.
